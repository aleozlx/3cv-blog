I'm Alex, a PhD student in Computer Science from University of Missouri, working for Data Science and Analytics Program as GRA/GTA.
I created this web site to document interesting discoveries and projects that may cross path with my research area.

My current focused areas are Computer Vision, Deep Learning, GPGPU programming and distributed computing.
